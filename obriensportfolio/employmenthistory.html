                  <h4>My most notable academic achievement has been Graduating from Eastern Gateway Community College as Summa Cum Laude with a Associates Degree in Information Technology.  
					I completed the degree in 14 months through 2021 - 2022 while maintaining a 4.0 gpa.  I am currently enrolled in a Computer Programming Certification course through 
					Bright Point Community College in Chesterfield Virginia.  Long before this in the early days of the 2000's I still had a passion for all things computer related.  I built
					 the foundations of knowledge for this at Clover Hill High School and also the Chesterfield Technical Center as I studied Cisco Networking, C++ Computer Programming and Comptia's A+.
					 As I entered adulthood I took this knowledge and tinkered with it, building simple and pointless scripts with my roommate, and running them on systems we cobbled 
					together from discards and "For Free" on craigslist we could find.  My current certifications are : CIW Website Developer - Associate, TestOut-Client Pro, TestOut-Linux Pro, 
					TestOut-PC Pro, TestOut-Routing and Switching Pro, TestOut-Security Pro, TestOut-Server 2016 Pro Install and Storage, and TestOut-Server 2016 Networking, Google
				 IT Support Specialization, and Certiport's IC3.  </h4>

							<h3><em>Technical Career Experience</em></h3>
						</div> 
                        <h4>I am currently employed with Boarshead as a BTS Specialist 1.  Working in a manufacturing plant that also has an administration building, my duties vary greatly from day to day.  
							One day I may be maintaining, troubleshooting, and installing an industrial printer system, ensuring that they have network connectivity, and that the automation sensors are 
							properly aligned, wired, and system inputs properly setup and recieving.  The next day I could be troubleshooting a user's work terminal, or using Intune for mass deployment of
							 a refresh project.  Currently the project that I have taken the inititive to work on is I am tracing the various Network lines, labeling them at the IDF, at the user's end,
							 and replacing or running new lines as needed. I am also creating documentation of what each port at the various servers is connected too.  In my capacity as an Analyst with 
							 De-Fi Logic I often am taking technical information and condensing explaining it to non-technical clients.  Before this I worked for Best Buy Geek Squad doing repairs, upgrades,
							  installations and recommending products for customers.  My first employment in the technical field though was with Tri-Wire, as a sub-contractor for Comcast.  As a contractor my duties
							revolved around running cable, installing or troubleshooting Comcast Devices.  These systems ranged from setting up and walking a customer how to use their 
							home network or even their security system.</h4>

							<h3><em>Law Enforcement Experience</em></h3>
						</div> 
                    <h4>Over the course of 10 years I was a Correctional Officer in 3 diffrent states.  During that time I specialized in special housing units,
						 most notably the Correctional Psychiatric Treatment Unit located at Kentucky State Reformatory.  These special posting assignments taught me
						  the importance of clear communication with diverse groups of people, and how to resolve situations where parties involved often have opposing intrests.
						    I also learned how to remain calm and keep a level head during stressfull times, and maintain an analytical mind. During my career as a Correctional Officer 
							I joined multiple specialty units ranging from CERT (Corrections Emergency Response Team) to Maryland's C.I.T. (Contraband Interdiction Team), 
							gaining skills and experience in people skills such as leading and training novice officers.

							<h3><em>General Employment Experience</em></h3>
						</div> 
                        <h4>In general employment I worked for multiple companies, often balancing two full time jobs learning to better balance my time, prioritize 
							responsabilities, and dedication to work.  My main and most lengthy employment in the general field was with CVS for about 7 years.
							  I started as a Pharmacy Technician eventually moving up to Supervision.  This built a foundation for people skills that helped 
							  me develop in my career later in life.  Working in the Pharmacy interpreting perscriptions and filling them taught me how to have 
							  attention to detail, and the importance of rectifying mistakes as quickly as possible when they do happen.
